Your responsibilities and obligations as a director shift dramatically
when your company becomes insolvent and you enter an environment where
you could be subject to personal responsibility. This article focuses
on what is legally defined as"insolvent and the various tests it must
pass to it, the effect it can have on your position as director, and
the best place to seek out help for insolvency.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the significance of insolvency?<br />
<br />
<br />
Under normal circumstances, the responsibilities of directors of a
business is to protect the interest of the business and its owners,
i.e. shareholders. If a company is insolvent, these obligations change
and directors' primary responsibility is to safeguard interest of
creditor. This is a significant aspect on how directors conduct
themselves when running the business. Failure to follow the correct
procedure could expose directors to risk of personal liability as well
as disqualification.&nbsp;&nbsp; </big><a href="https://business-insolvency-helpline.co.uk"><big>small business insolvency advice</big></a><br />
<big><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a belief that the directors of a business must cease their
business in the event that the business is declared insolvent. However,
this isn't the case since directors may legitimately try for ways to
exit their problems. If they do decide to attempt to do this, they must
be extremely vigilant and show that they had a reasonable chance of
being able to achieve this in order to stay clear of any possible
danger from Wrongful Trading under Section 214 of the Insolvency Act
1986. If you persist in trading beyond the point you should have been
able to stop because there was no chance of being able to avoid an
insolvent liquidation then you could be personally liable for any
additional losses the creditors suffer from this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, following the liquidation process, the insolvency
practitioner will review the actions that were taken during the time
leading up to the time of insolvency (and when they are related
parties, this examination can be extend to a number of years prior to
the date of insolvency). They will be looking for evidence which could
be considered to be fraudulent as transactions undervalue (where the
assets you purchased were sold for less than their actual worth) and
Preferences (where you place the creditors of a particular group in
better situation than they otherwise would be) under Sections 238 or
239 under the Insolvency Act 1986 respectively.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All of these are issues which an Insolvency Practitioner must take into
consideration when writing their report regarding the conduct of
directors and forms the basis for the decision whether to ask for your
disqualification as director.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The tests for insolvency<br />
<br />
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 sets out the mandatory tests for
insolvency. They are the company is either insolvent or insolvent and
cannot pay its debts in the time they become due (often called the
"cash flow test") or the assets of the company are less than the
liabilities (often known as the "balance sheet test").<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Failure to respond to any valid demand under the stipulated timeframe
or to be in compliance with the requirements of a court judgement are
considered to be evidence specific that a business is insolvent to meet
its obligations and enough on its own to allow a creditor the right to
submit the winding up petition.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From the director's point of from a director's point of view, the cash
flow test is to consider whether the business will be able to meet its
obligations at the time they are due to be paid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're having difficulties with cash flow and being forced to pay
your suppliers past their due dates, or not paying your PAYE/NI/ VAT
payments in time, your business might be insolvent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A balance sheet examination is designed to determine whether the
business owes money in debt to creditors than amount of its assets.
Reviewing the balance sheet won't suffice to determine this, however,
since the test has to include future and contingent liabilities. When
they are taken into consideration these could increase the value of
liabilities significantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the balance sheet hasn't been adjusted to reflect the value of
obsolete stocks or plant and equipment as well as if the allowance for
bad loans is not sufficient and the amount of assets listed on the
balance sheet could be understated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is also accurate that accounting is usually done using an ongoing
basis, as well. In the case of a bankruptcy, the value of assets that
can be realized are often significantly lower than the going concern
book values.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When you take these into account If the company's liabilities exceed its assets, the company may be considered insolvent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't panic, but do act<br />
<br />
<br />
If you feel that your business fails one of the tests above, then you, as a director, must act quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As mentioned previously, there is no need to immediately stop trading.
Actually, developing and implementing an turnaround plan to navigate
through and out of challenges or raise new capital, could be the right
method for a prudent board of directors to pursue. But as directors who
are responsible must take into consideration is the new responsibility
and whether you need to continue to trade in context of these. Keep in
mind that from now you are required to safeguard the interests of
creditors, not shareholders.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is therefore important to create forecasts that outline how you
anticipate trading to go in accordance with your plan, paying
particular attention to how you'd like this to impact the financial
position of your company's creditors. Make sure you record your
conversations and the foundation of your decisions, and then be sure to
monitor your performance according to the plan as you move towards the
future.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://business-insolvency-helpline.co.uk"><span style="font-weight: bold;">insolvency advice for small businesses</span></a><br />

Importantly, you must get professional advice by speaking with a
competent insolvency practitioner, an insolvency solicitor , or an
accredited turnaround specialist as early as you can during the
process, so that you can be sure to protect your position.<br />

legal issues that are involved. you must always seek professional
advice regarding your specific circumstances prior to making any
